**Description :** In this project, I explored the oldest business in the world when they were founded, and which industries they belong to.Like many business problems, the data is contained in several different datasets. In order to understand the world's oldest businesses, I first needed to use joining techniques to merge our data. From there, I used manipulation tools such as grouping and filtering to answer questions about these historic businesses.  <br>

**Description :**In this project, I analyzed video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977. I searched for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that users and critics liked best, and I explored the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data. My search involved joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. I also filtered, grouped, and ordered data.  <br>
